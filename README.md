## Introduction
Brick Breaker is an open source 2D game made with engine Unity3D.</br></br>
I made this game while I was studying the Unity3D course "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games" of Ben Tristem, GameDev.tv Team, Rick Davidson and I made this a better version of Block Breaker from the course. </br> </br>
All game assets are free to use, I'm pretty sure about that. Anyway, if there any issue with copyright, please contact me at son.nguyen2912@hcmut.edu.vn.
